                  It has been a crazy journey so far. So many ups and downs. But you have always stood with me. You have completely transformed me as a person. I have learnt so many things from you. Being patient, being more productive, giving my 110 percent, importance of peace and happiness, spirituality and many more things. You made me more focused in my life. You always pushed me to be better. You brought out the best version of me. Nobody has a bigger impact on my life than you. These 2 years seem too long and too short at the same time. We will celebrate many more anniversaries together. This is just the beginning. I am super lucky to have you. You are a queen, an angel, Devi ji, you are wonder woman. You are the most innocent person I've ever met. You are innocent like a child. Still you have immense mental strength. You always stay calm. You never think bad about anyone. You always see both side of story without jumping to conclusions. You are the center of positivity. You are the definition of perfect human being. Keep slaying my Queen 👑. I am always with you. Forever and ever and ever...
